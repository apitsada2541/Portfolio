    "Since we're working on sentiment analysis, LLM-only method seems to already doing a good job. However, if we're not specifying that we're asking about book, the LLM does not give response related to books. Basic rag usually only gives reviews in the vector db that is related to query without clearly answer the questions except for some of the queries. HyDE and reranking + summarization seem to perform well. Sometimes they give responses that similar to LLM-only, however, their responses seem to take the information in vector db into consideration, hence, they give more definite answers than the LLM. Still, reranking and summarization usually covers all answer or gives more important details than HyDE."
