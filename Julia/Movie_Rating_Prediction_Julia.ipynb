    "1. Type Annotations:\n",
    "Julia requires explicit type annotations in function definitions (e.g., input::String) Python doesn't use type annotations by default but supports them with typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. String Processing:\n",
    "Julia uses replace for replacing characters and a regex syntax different from Python's. Python might use .translate() or re.sub() for similar purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lowercasing:\n",
    "Julia's lowercase is analogous to Python's .lower().\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dictionary Operations:\n",
    "Julia's get function allows fetching a default value for keys, similar to Python's .get() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No Built-in Counter:\n",
    "Unlike Python's collections.Counter, Julia requires manually counting word occurrences using dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Return Values:\n",
    "Julia uses tuples for multiple return values. Python uses tuples similarly, but Julia's syntax for unpacking might differ slightly."

Approaching middle age, George feels as if life is passing him by, especially his sex life. Despite the presence of longtime lady friend Sam (Julie Andrews) in his life, he becomes obsessed from afar with Jenny (Bo Derek), who is engaged to be married. Following her to Mexico without her knowledge, George arranges a meeting with Jenny by saving the life of her fianc√©, David (Sam Jones). Once he has made her acquaintance, George suddenly finds himself faced with the realities of embarking on such an affair. Beyond renewing the popularity of Maurice Ravel&apos;s &apos;Bolero&apos; and turning Bo Derek into a star, upon its release, 10 was one of the most financially successful Blake Edwards films in years. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Comedy, Romance</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Blake Edwards</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1979-10-05</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1997-08-27</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">118</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">68</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">22</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">53</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">14670</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">4</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">4</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">12 Angry Men (Twelve Angry Men)</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">A Puerto Rican youth is on trial for murder, accused of knifing his father to death. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room, having been admonished that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven of the jurors vote for conviction, each for reasons of his own. The sole holdout is Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. As Fonda persuades the weary jurors to re-examine the evidence, we learn the backstory of each man. Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a bullying self-made man, has estranged himself from his own son. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) has an ingrained mistrust of foreigners; so, to a lesser extent, does Juror #6 (Edward Binns). Jurors #10 (Ed Begley) and #11 (George Voskovec), so certain of the infallibility of the Law, assume that if the boy was arrested, he must be guilty. Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) is an advocate of dispassionate deductive reasoning. Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), like the defendant a product of &apos;the streets,&apos; hopes that his guilty vote will distance himself from his past. Juror #12 (Robert Webber), an advertising man, doesn&apos;t understand anything that he can&apos;t package and market. And Jurors #1 (Martin Balsam), #2 (John Fiedler) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney), anxious not to make waves, &apos;go with the flow.&apos; The excruciatingly hot day drags into an even hotter night; still, Fonda chips away at the guilty verdict, insisting that his fellow jurors bear in mind those words &apos;reasonable doubt.&apos; A pet project of Henry Fonda&apos;s, Twelve Angry Men was his only foray into film production; the actor&apos;s partner in this venture was Reginald Rose, who wrote the 1954 television play on which the film was based. Carried over from the TV version was director Sidney Lumet, here making his feature-film debut. A flop when it first came out (surprisingly, since it cost almost nothing to make), Twelve Angry Men holds up beautifully when seen today. It was remade for television in 1997 by director William Friedkin with Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi</td><td style = \"font-style: italic; text-align: left;\">missing</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Classics, Drama</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Sidney Lumet</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2057-04-13</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2001-03-06</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">95</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">100</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">51</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">97</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">105000</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">5</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">5</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">20,000 Leagues Under The Sea</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">This 1954 Disney version of Jules Verne&apos;s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea represented the studio&apos;s costliest and most elaborate American-filmed effort to date.

Griffith epic is the only talking-picture effort to encapsulate the entire life of Abraham Lincoln, from cradle to grave. The script, credited to Stephen Vincent Benet, manages to include all the familiar high points, including Lincoln&apos;s tragic romance with Ann Rutledge (Una Merkel, allegedly cast because of her resemblance to Griffith favorite Lillian Gish), his lawyer days in Illinois, his contentious marriage to Mary Todd (Kay Hammond), his heartbreaking decision to declare war upon the South, his pardoning of a condemned sentry during the Civil War, and his assassination at the hands of John Wilkes Booth (expansively portrayed by Ian Keith). This was D.W. Griffith&apos;s first talkie, and the master does his best with the somewhat pedantic dialogue sequences; but as always, Griffith&apos;s forte was spectacle and montage, as witness the cross-cut scenes of Yankees and Rebels marching off to war and the pulse-pounding ride of General Sheridan (Frank Campeau) through the Shenandoah Valley. Thanks to the wizardry of production designer William Cameron Menzies, many of the scenes appear far more elaborate than they really were; Menzies can also be credited with the unforgettable finale, as Honest Abe&apos;s Kentucky log cabin dissolves to the Lincoln Memorial. As Abraham Lincoln, Walter Huston is a tower of strength, making even the most florid of speeches sound human and credible; only during the protracted death scene of Ann Rutledge does Huston falter, and then the fault is as much Griffith&apos;s as his. Road-shown at nearly two hours (including a prologue showing slaves being brought to America), Abraham Lincoln was pared down to 97 minutes by United Artists, and in that length it proved a box-office success, boding well for D.W. Griffith&apos;s future in talkies (alas, it proved to be his next-to-last film; Griffith&apos;s final effort, The Struggle was a financial disaster).</td><td style = \"font-style: italic; text-align: left;\">missing</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Classics, Drama</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">D.W.

In Japan&apos;s family court system, which is heavily weighted towards the mother, Yoshimi case would normally be a piece of cake. Unfortunately, Yoshimi has a history of mental imbalance as a result of her miserable, emotionally starved childhood. The transition from housewife to independent working woman has been stressful. She has moved into a fleabag of an apartment -- completely with a constantly leaking roof -- and has had little luck finding employment. Worse, Ikuko and then Yoshimi start seeing a creepy little girl dressed in yellow suddenly appearing in apartment. With a growing sense of dread, Yoshimi starts having outbursts not only in family court, but also at her daughter&apos;s kindergarten.

While it seems a straightforward enough case, there are some complicating issues involving the character and intent of the victim herself and also the culpability amongst those who witnessed the crime and did nothing to stop it. Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster in a mesmerizing Oscar-winning turn) is a hard-living sexy little fireball who loves to party with her friends. The night of the rape, she had a fight with her boy friend and so goes to the bar to blow off a little steam. In the dark back room where the pool tables sit and pinball machines flash dimly against the walls, Sarah begins casually flirting, dancing around, drinking a bit and the next thing she knows she is tossed upon a pinball machine being brutally ravaged with guys lined up to have their way with her while other patrons stand around cheering. Badly beaten and traumatized, she ends up in the DA&apos;s office facing attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) who listens and takes the case. But as Murphy learns more about Sarah, she becomes less pleased, for Sarah has a long, checkered past of drugs, booze and casual acquaintances that the defense can easily use to destroy her character. Rather than risk that, Murphy goes for a plea bargain that grants the guilty light sentences and frees them from having to admit that they committed rape. Sarah goes ballistic when she hears about the trial and harshly derides Murphy. The lawyer seems unsympathetic at first, but then she sees first hand the devastation the rape has wrought upon Sarah&apos;s life and decides to defy her bosses and continue fighting for justice using an entirely new tack.

It&apos;s 2003, America has invaded Iraq, and Port Gamble, Washington is a town in the Pacific Northwest that&apos;s fallen on hard times; fishing in the nearby harbor has dried up, local businesses are closing, and a lot of folks in town are looking for someone to blame for their troubles. Frida (Janette Armand), a college student of Middle Eastern descent, has come home for the summer to work in her dad&apos;s diner, and has to deal with narrow-minded locals who foolishly suspect she might be a terrorist. Meanwhile, Tom (Doug Fahl), who left Port Gamble years before, is wary about returning to visit his mother; Tom is gay, and has come home to tell his mom about his sexual orientation and introduce her to his boyfriend Lance (Cooper Hopkins). However, Frida&apos;s work behind the counter and Tom&apos;s revelation to his family take a back seat when a pack of hungry, flesh-eating zombies invade Port Gamble, and the most narrow-minded members of the community are forced to throw in their lot with some folks they&apos;re not sure they trust to fight off the undead mob.

He is &apos;adopted&apos; by the flamboyant Zorba, who determines to educate Bates in the ways of the world-or, to be more precise, Zorba&apos;s world. Along the way, Bates is introduced to widow Irene Papas, the unrequited love object of everyone on the island, who comes to a tragic end when she is accused of adultery. The writer is also a spectator to the equally benighted romance between Zorba and venerable courtesan Lila Kedrova. Other disasters follow, but Zorba is able to convince Bates that failure is an inescapable part of life, and that only by constantly tasting defeat can one truly enjoy life&apos;s victories.

The twelve jurors retire to the jury room, having been admonished that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven of the jurors vote for conviction, each for reasons of his own. The sole holdout is Juror \\#8, played by Henry Fonda. As Fonda persuades the weary jurors to re-examine the evidence, we learn the backstory of each man. Juror \\#3 (Lee J. Cobb), a bullying self-made man, has estranged himself from his own son. Juror \\#7 (Jack Warden) has an ingrained mistrust of foreigners; so, to a lesser extent, does Juror \\#6 (Edward Binns). Jurors \\#10 (Ed Begley) and \\#11 (George Voskovec), so certain of the infallibility of the Law, assume that if the boy was arrested, he must be guilty. Juror \\#4 (E.G.

Juror \\#12 (Robert Webber), an advertising man, doesn't understand anything that he can't package and market.

The excruciatingly hot day drags into an even hotter night; still, Fonda chips away at the guilty verdict, insisting that his fellow jurors bear in mind those words 'reasonable doubt.' A pet project of Henry Fonda's, Twelve Angry Men was his only foray into film production; the actor's partner in this venture was Reginald Rose, who wrote the 1954 television play on which the film was based. Carried over from the TV version was director Sidney Lumet, here making his feature-film debut. A flop when it first came out (surprisingly, since it cost almost nothing to make), Twelve Angry Men holds up beautifully when seen today.

       "\t10 & 10 & Abraham Lincoln & To date, this D.W. Griffith epic is the only talking-picture effort to encapsulate the entire life of Abraham Lincoln, from cradle to grave. The script, credited to Stephen Vincent Benet, manages to include all the familiar high points, including Lincoln's tragic romance with Ann Rutledge (Una Merkel, allegedly cast because of her resemblance to Griffith favorite Lillian Gish), his lawyer days in Illinois, his contentious marriage to Mary Todd (Kay Hammond), his heartbreaking decision to declare war upon the South, his pardoning of a condemned sentry during the Civil War, and his assassination at the hands of John Wilkes Booth (expansively portrayed by Ian Keith). This was D.W. Griffith's first talkie, and the master does his best with the somewhat pedantic dialogue sequences; but as always, Griffith's forte was spectacle and montage, as witness the cross-cut scenes of Yankees and Rebels marching off to war and the pulse-pounding ride of General Sheridan (Frank Campeau) through the Shenandoah Valley. Thanks to the wizardry of production designer William Cameron Menzies, many of the scenes appear far more elaborate than they really were; Menzies can also be credited with the unforgettable finale, as Honest Abe's Kentucky log cabin dissolves to the Lincoln Memorial. As Abraham Lincoln, Walter Huston is a tower of strength, making even the most florid of speeches sound human and credible; only during the protracted death scene of Ann Rutledge does Huston falter, and then the fault is as much Griffith's as his. Road-shown at nearly two hours (including a prologue showing slaves being brought to America), Abraham Lincoln was pared down to 97 minutes by United Artists, and in that length it proved a box-office success, boding well for D.W. Griffith's future in talkies (alas, it proved to be his next-to-last film; Griffith's final effort, The Struggle was a financial disaster). & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) is the midst of a nasty divorce with her thuggish, abusive husband over the custody of their five year old daughter Ikuko (Rio Kanno). In Japan's family court system, which is heavily weighted towards the mother, Yoshimi case would normally be a piece of cake. Unfortunately, Yoshimi has a history of mental imbalance as a result of her miserable, emotionally starved childhood. The transition from housewife to independent working woman has been stressful. She has moved into a fleabag of an apartment -- completely with a constantly leaking roof -- and has had little luck finding employment. Worse, Ikuko and then Yoshimi start seeing a creepy little girl dressed in yellow suddenly appearing in apartment. With a growing sense of dread, Yoshimi starts having outbursts not only in family court, but also at her daughter's kindergarten. When she slumps into a coma after the end of one such fit, she realizes what the girl in yellow is trying to communicate. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t13 & 12 & The Accused & Simultaneously gut-wrenching and provocative, The Accused follows the struggle of a young woman to find justice after she is publicly gang-raped in a local tavern. While it seems a straightforward enough case, there are some complicating issues involving the character and intent of the victim herself and also the culpability amongst those who witnessed the crime and did nothing to stop it. Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster in a mesmerizing Oscar-winning turn) is a hard-living sexy little fireball who loves to party with her friends. The night of the rape, she had a fight with her boy friend and so goes to the bar to blow off a little steam. In the dark back room where the pool tables sit and pinball machines flash dimly against the walls, Sarah begins casually flirting, dancing around, drinking a bit and the next thing she knows she is tossed upon a pinball machine being brutally ravaged with guys lined up to have their way with her while other patrons stand around cheering. Badly beaten and traumatized, she ends up in the DA's office facing attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) who listens and takes the case. But as Murphy learns more about Sarah, she becomes less pleased, for Sarah has a long, checkered past of drugs, booze and casual acquaintances that the defense can easily use to destroy her character. Rather than risk that, Murphy goes for a plea bargain that grants the guilty light sentences and frees them from having to admit that they committed rape. Sarah goes ballistic when she hears about the trial and harshly derides Murphy. The lawyer seems unsympathetic at first, but then she sees first hand the devastation the rape has wrought upon Sarah's life and decides to defy her bosses and continue fighting for justice using an entirely new tack. This time, instead of going after the rapists, she is going after the 'passive' onlookers who may or may not have encouraged the crime. The Accused is loosely based upon the true story of a much-publicized 1983 case from New Bedford, Massachusetts. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t14 & 13 & The Lost City & Andy Garcia stars and makes his directorial debut in a passionate and historical tribute to his native Cuba. Havana in 1958 is a place of pleasure for many, but others are not happy under the rule of Dictator Fulgencio Batista. As the revolutionary forces of Fidel Castro and Ernesto 'Che' Guevara prepare to move on the city, Fico Fellove -- owner of the city's classiest music nightclub, El Tropico -- struggles to hold together his family and the love of a woman, not knowing that his club will become more than just a stage for popular entertainment. Observing all is The Writer an ex-patriot American who sees Fico being drawn into events as the revolution changes everything. Though Fico watches a culture vanish and a people transformed, it is his love of Cuban music that keeps his memories alive. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t15 & 14 & The Breaking Point & In this taut adaptation of Hemingway's To Have and Have Not a financially struggling charter-boat captain finds himself in deep and turbulent water when he is forced to get involved with smugglers after a dishonest millionaire cheats him out of pay during a fishing excursion to Mexico; the louse also leaves his seductive girl friend, a hooker, stranded on the boat. The desperate captain agrees to illegally smuggle Chinese refugees into the US, but during the voyage, he is again double-crossed and must force his hapless passengers to jump ship when the Coast Guard suddenly appears. They take his boat away from him. Deeply depressed, he has sex with the abandoned woman and then goes home. Meanwhile, the crooked lawyer who talked him into smuggling the refugees, gets the captain's boat back and then blackmails him into taking a gang of crooks to Catalina Island. During the 26-mile voyage things come to a head when one of the crooks kills the skipper's first mate. Suddenly the captain snaps and he finally gets his revenge. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t16 & 15 & Adam's Rib & Written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, Adam's Rib is a peerless comedy predicated on the double standard. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn play Adam and Amanda Bonner, a husband-and-wife attorney team, both drawn to a case of attempted murder. The defendant (Judy Holliday) had tearfully attempted to shoot her husband (Tom Ewell) and his mistress (Jean Hagen). Adam argues that the case is open and shut, but Amanda points out that, if the defendant were a man, he'd be set free on the basis of 'the unwritten law.' Thus it is that Adam works on behalf of the prosecution, while Amanda defends the accused woman. The trial turns into a media circus, while the Bonners' home life suffers. Adam's Rib represented the film debuts of New York-based actors Jean Hagen, Tom Ewell, and David Wayne (as Hepburn's erstwhile songwriting suitor), and the return to Hollywood of Judy Holliday after her Born Yesterday triumph. One of the best of the Tracy-Hepburn efforts, it inspired a brief 1973 TV series starring Ken Howard and Blythe Danner. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t17 & 16 & The Bridge of San Luis Rey & Thornton Wilder's award-winning novel is given a lavish screen adaptation in this historical drama from writer and director Mary McGuckian. In Peru in 1714, a rickety bridge collapsed as five people were attempting to cross, forcing them to plunge to their deaths. Brother Fray Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) is a Franciscan monk who has been given the duty of looking into the tragedy by the archbishop of Lima (Robert De Niro), and to learn what he can about the victims. It is Juniper's belief that these particular people died for some reason, and that it is his duty to determine why God chose these five people to perish, while others in the vicinity survived. After five years, Juniper delivers his findings to the archbishop as well as the viceroy of Peru (F. Murray Abraham), as Juniper tells them of the lives of the troubled Dona Maria (Kathy Bates), the nun Pepita (Adriana Dominguez), warm-hearted Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel), street kid-turned-actress La Perichola (Pilar Lopez de Ayala), and others involved in the tragedy. The Bridge of San Luis Rey also features Geraldine Chaplin, John Lynch, and brothers Mark Polish and Michael Polish. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

Responding to a prowler complaint at the home of Susan Gilvray (Evelyn Keyes), he is immediately attracted to her and her wealth. He returns to 'check up' on Susan, and they begin an affair, conducted while listening to her husband John (Sherry Hall)'s all-night radio program. Feeling guilty, Susan ends the relationship, but Garwood remains obsessed. He pretends to be a prowler on the Gilvray property so he can respond to another police call. Drawing William outside, he shoots him and makes it appear accidental. When Garwood manipulates Susan's confusion about the shooting, she buys his story, and the lovers marry. However, upon discovering that Susan is pregnant 'too soon,' they flee to give birth in secret, but eventually Susan learns the devastating truth. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

       "\t22 & 21 & The Adventures of Robin Hood & In order to avoid the material copyrighted by Douglas Fairbanks Sr. for his 1922 Robin Hood, the scripters of this Flynn version relied on several legendary episodes that had never before been filmed, notably the battle between Robin and Little John (Alan Hale Sr., who played this part three times in his long career) and the 'piggy-back' episode between Robin and Friar Tuck (Eugene Pallette). The film ties together the various ancient anecdotes with a storyline bounded by the capture in Austria of Richard the Lionheart (Ian Hunter) on one end and Richard's triumphant return to England on the other. Robin Hood is already an outlaw at the outset of the film, while Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland) is initially part of the enemy camp, as one of Prince John's (Claude Rains) entourage. Marian warms up to Robin's fight against injustice (and to Robin himself), eventually becoming a trusted ally. James Cagney was originally announced for the role of Robin Hood, just before Cagney left Warner Bros. in a salary dispute. William Keighley was the original director, but he worked too slowly to suit the tight production schedule and was replaced by Michael Curtiz (both men receive screen credit). A lengthy opening jousting sequence was shot but removed from the final print; portions of this sequence show up as stock footage in the 1957 Warners film The Story of Mankind. The chestnut-colored Palomino horse ridden by de Havilland in the Sherwood Forest scenes later gained screen stardom as Roy Rogers' Trigger. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t23 & 22 & Man Hunt & A hunter finds himself in a world of danger when he decides to stalk Adolf Hitler in this taut WWII thriller. Capt. Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon) is an expert big-game hunter from England. While hunting in Bavaria, he happens upon Hitler's Berchtesgaden estate and spots the Fuhrer; he has his rifle in tow, and he toys with the idea of firing at the dictator, even raising the unloaded weapon, putting Hitler in the crosshairs, and pulling the trigger to make the gun click. Unfortunately, this draws the attention of Maj. Quive-Smith (George Sanders), a Gestapo leader assigned to guard the F√ºhrer, who promptly apprehends Thorndike, drags him off and attempts to force him to sign a confession. When he refuses, he's brutally beaten and dumped into a hole in the woods, and must climb out and make his way to safety, by hiding as a stowaway on a Danish steamer. The poor fellow then runs afoul of the menacing Mr. Jones (John Carradine), who steals his passport and identity. By the time Thorndike returns to London, the hunter has become the hunted, with Gestapo agents combing the streets looking for the would-be assassin. Man Hunt was directed by Fritz Lang, the great German director who fled to Paris in 1933 rather than accept a commission from Joseph Goebbels to make Nazi propaganda films. He came to America the following year. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t24 & 23 & Dead End & A family making their annual Christmas pilgrimage to Grandmother's house finds their journey taking an ominous turn when they attempt to take an unfamiliar shortcut in this low-key chiller from first-time director Jean-Baptiste Andrea. For 20 years, Frank Harrington (Ray Wise) has driven the same, mind-numbingly familiar route to the annual holiday gathering, but the discovery of an unfamiliar shortcut simply proves too enticing for the loving but strained father to resist. As the road grows increasingly dark, the eerie sight of a young woman carrying a small infant sets into motion a horrific series of roadside deaths that finds the family's numbers quickly dwindling. Though there are no other travelers on the long and dark stretch of road, the appearance of a menacing black hearse seems somehow connected to the spectral woman and her child. Could it be that a vengeful entity was the previous victim of a roadside accident, returning to torment any trespasser who happens to wander down her silent stretch of road, or could the answer to the horrific mystery lie deep within the conscience of one of the few remaining family-members? & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t25 & 24 & Bandwagon & A group of hard-working, young North Carolinians amuse themselves in the evenings by forming a band. This ensemble comedy chronicles their experiences. Tony Ridge is the singer/songwriter. Though talented, he is so introverted that he can only play his music in a closet. After he loses his day job, his out-going friend Charlie Flagg suggests he try to become a professional musician. Tony decides to give it a go, but first they need a band. They choose stoner guitarist Wynn Knapp, who despite his perpetual drug-inspired haze is really good, and then the volatile Eric Ellwood as their bassist. Ellwood is extremely eager to get the money rolling in as he is deeply in debt to a big, mean loan shark. Unfortunately, the shark has Ellwood's bass. The four then stage a break-in and get it back. After practice, their band Circus Monkey is finally ready to perform. At least they think so and go to play at a frat party. Unfortunately they bomb because their music isn't hard enough for the rowdy, drunken kids. Undaunted, they continue on and eventually score themselves a manager with Linus Tate, a sage but quiet man.

The film focuses on the seminal Ferus Gallery, which groomed the LA art scene from a loose band of idealistic beatniks into a coterie of competitive, often brilliant artists, including Ed Kienholz, Ed Ruscha, Craig Kauffman, Wallace Berman, Ed Moses and Robert Irwin. The Ferus also served as launching point for New York imports, Andy Warhol (hosting his first Soup Can show), Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein as well as leading to the first Pop Art show and Marcel Duchamp's first retrospective. What was lost and gained is tied up in a complex web of egos, passions, money, and art. This is how L.A. came of age. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

When St√©phanie's mother (who is still in deep denial about her son's new life) falls seriously ill, she travels to the small town where she was born to help care for her. Mikhail opts to tag along, and when business starts to dry up in Paris, Jamel follows them to the country.

Vito Rossi (Vincent Pastore) and Frank Bianco (Frank Vincent) are two men who used to work together in the same pizza parlor in Yonkers, NY, but when their mentor Emilio (Louis Guss) retired, he decided to give his secret formula for perfect crust to Vito, and his recipe for the best sauce in town to Frank. Now the two men are bitter rivals, each running their own pizza place and constantly battling over who has the best pie in town. However, Vito's daughter Angela (Robin Paul) recently graduated from business school, and has big plans for shifting the family business into overdrive. Frank, meanwhile, has an idea of his own for getting ahead -- he'll persuade his handsome twenty-something son Tony (Conor Dubin), a budding cartoonist, to romance Angela, and hopefully persuade her to reveal her family's share of the famous pizza recipe. However, something unexpected happens -- Angela and Tony fall in love, despite the bad blood between their families, and have to figure out a way to break the unexpected news to their families.

Plus, there&apos;s the neighbors: cranky, elderly Andra and the two granddaughters who look after her.</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Comedy</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Nicole Holofcener</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2010-04-30</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2010-10-19</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">90</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">86</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">140</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">64</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">11567</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">3</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">3</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">10</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Blake Edwards&apos; 10 stars Dudley Moore as George, a Mancini-type songwriter. Approaching middle age, George feels as if life is passing him by, especially his sex life. Despite the presence of longtime lady friend Sam (Julie Andrews) in his life, he becomes obsessed from afar with Jenny (Bo Derek), who is engaged to be married. Following her to Mexico without her knowledge, George arranges a meeting with Jenny by saving the life of her fianc√©, David (Sam Jones). Once he has made her acquaintance, George suddenly finds himself faced with the realities of embarking on such an affair. Beyond renewing the popularity of Maurice Ravel&apos;s &apos;Bolero&apos; and turning Bo Derek into a star, upon its release, 10 was one of the most financially successful Blake Edwards films in years. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Comedy, Romance</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Blake Edwards</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1979-10-05</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1997-08-27</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">118</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">68</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">22</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">53</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">14670</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">4</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">5</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">20,000 Leagues Under The Sea</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">This 1954 Disney version of Jules Verne&apos;s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea represented the studio&apos;s costliest and most elaborate American-filmed effort to date.

In Japan&apos;s family court system, which is heavily weighted towards the mother, Yoshimi case would normally be a piece of cake. Unfortunately, Yoshimi has a history of mental imbalance as a result of her miserable, emotionally starved childhood. The transition from housewife to independent working woman has been stressful. She has moved into a fleabag of an apartment -- completely with a constantly leaking roof -- and has had little luck finding employment. Worse, Ikuko and then Yoshimi start seeing a creepy little girl dressed in yellow suddenly appearing in apartment. With a growing sense of dread, Yoshimi starts having outbursts not only in family court, but also at her daughter&apos;s kindergarten. When she slumps into a coma after the end of one such fit, she realizes what the girl in yellow is trying to communicate.</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">PG-13</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Art House &amp; International, Horror, Mystery &amp; Suspense</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Hideo Nakata</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2002-01-19</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2005-06-21</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">100</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">80</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">15</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">66</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">21459</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">9</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">12</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">The Accused</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Simultaneously gut-wrenching and provocative, The Accused follows the struggle of a young woman to find justice after she is publicly gang-raped in a local tavern. While it seems a straightforward enough case, there are some complicating issues involving the character and intent of the victim herself and also the culpability amongst those who witnessed the crime and did nothing to stop it. Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster in a mesmerizing Oscar-winning turn) is a hard-living sexy little fireball who loves to party with her friends. The night of the rape, she had a fight with her boy friend and so goes to the bar to blow off a little steam. In the dark back room where the pool tables sit and pinball machines flash dimly against the walls, Sarah begins casually flirting, dancing around, drinking a bit and the next thing she knows she is tossed upon a pinball machine being brutally ravaged with guys lined up to have their way with her while other patrons stand around cheering. Badly beaten and traumatized, she ends up in the DA&apos;s office facing attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) who listens and takes the case. But as Murphy learns more about Sarah, she becomes less pleased, for Sarah has a long, checkered past of drugs, booze and casual acquaintances that the defense can easily use to destroy her character. Rather than risk that, Murphy goes for a plea bargain that grants the guilty light sentences and frees them from having to admit that they committed rape. Sarah goes ballistic when she hears about the trial and harshly derides Murphy. The lawyer seems unsympathetic at first, but then she sees first hand the devastation the rape has wrought upon Sarah&apos;s life and decides to defy her bosses and continue fighting for justice using an entirely new tack. This time, instead of going after the rapists, she is going after the &apos;passive&apos; onlookers who may or may not have encouraged the crime. The Accused is loosely based upon the true story of a much-publicized 1983 case from New Bedford, Massachusetts.</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Drama, Mystery &amp; Suspense</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Jonathan Kaplan</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1988-10-14</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2002-04-16</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">110</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">91</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">22</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">79</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">20796</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">10</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">13</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">The Lost City</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Andy Garcia stars and makes his directorial debut in a passionate and historical tribute to his native Cuba.

Brother Fray Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) is a Franciscan monk who has been given the duty of looking into the tragedy by the archbishop of Lima (Robert De Niro), and to learn what he can about the victims. It is Juniper&apos;s belief that these particular people died for some reason, and that it is his duty to determine why God chose these five people to perish, while others in the vicinity survived. After five years, Juniper delivers his findings to the archbishop as well as the viceroy of Peru (F. Murray Abraham), as Juniper tells them of the lives of the troubled Dona Maria (Kathy Bates), the nun Pepita (Adriana Dominguez), warm-hearted Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel), street kid-turned-actress La Perichola (Pilar Lopez de Ayala), and others involved in the tragedy.

       "\t9 & 12 & The Accused & Simultaneously gut-wrenching and provocative, The Accused follows the struggle of a young woman to find justice after she is publicly gang-raped in a local tavern. While it seems a straightforward enough case, there are some complicating issues involving the character and intent of the victim herself and also the culpability amongst those who witnessed the crime and did nothing to stop it. Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster in a mesmerizing Oscar-winning turn) is a hard-living sexy little fireball who loves to party with her friends. The night of the rape, she had a fight with her boy friend and so goes to the bar to blow off a little steam. In the dark back room where the pool tables sit and pinball machines flash dimly against the walls, Sarah begins casually flirting, dancing around, drinking a bit and the next thing she knows she is tossed upon a pinball machine being brutally ravaged with guys lined up to have their way with her while other patrons stand around cheering. Badly beaten and traumatized, she ends up in the DA's office facing attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) who listens and takes the case. But as Murphy learns more about Sarah, she becomes less pleased, for Sarah has a long, checkered past of drugs, booze and casual acquaintances that the defense can easily use to destroy her character. Rather than risk that, Murphy goes for a plea bargain that grants the guilty light sentences and frees them from having to admit that they committed rape. Sarah goes ballistic when she hears about the trial and harshly derides Murphy. The lawyer seems unsympathetic at first, but then she sees first hand the devastation the rape has wrought upon Sarah's life and decides to defy her bosses and continue fighting for justice using an entirely new tack. This time, instead of going after the rapists, she is going after the 'passive' onlookers who may or may not have encouraged the crime. The Accused is loosely based upon the true story of a much-publicized 1983 case from New Bedford, Massachusetts. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

Brother Fray Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) is a Franciscan monk who has been given the duty of looking into the tragedy by the archbishop of Lima (Robert De Niro), and to learn what he can about the victims. It is Juniper's belief that these particular people died for some reason, and that it is his duty to determine why God chose these five people to perish, while others in the vicinity survived. After five years, Juniper delivers his findings to the archbishop as well as the viceroy of Peru (F. Murray Abraham), as Juniper tells them of the lives of the troubled Dona Maria (Kathy Bates), the nun Pepita (Adriana Dominguez), warm-hearted Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel), street kid-turned-actress La Perichola (Pilar Lopez de Ayala), and others involved in the tragedy.

       "\t15 & 21 & The Adventures of Robin Hood & In order to avoid the material copyrighted by Douglas Fairbanks Sr. for his 1922 Robin Hood, the scripters of this Flynn version relied on several legendary episodes that had never before been filmed, notably the battle between Robin and Little John (Alan Hale Sr., who played this part three times in his long career) and the 'piggy-back' episode between Robin and Friar Tuck (Eugene Pallette). The film ties together the various ancient anecdotes with a storyline bounded by the capture in Austria of Richard the Lionheart (Ian Hunter) on one end and Richard's triumphant return to England on the other. Robin Hood is already an outlaw at the outset of the film, while Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland) is initially part of the enemy camp, as one of Prince John's (Claude Rains) entourage. Marian warms up to Robin's fight against injustice (and to Robin himself), eventually becoming a trusted ally. James Cagney was originally announced for the role of Robin Hood, just before Cagney left Warner Bros. in a salary dispute. William Keighley was the original director, but he worked too slowly to suit the tight production schedule and was replaced by Michael Curtiz (both men receive screen credit). A lengthy opening jousting sequence was shot but removed from the final print; portions of this sequence show up as stock footage in the 1957 Warners film The Story of Mankind. The chestnut-colored Palomino horse ridden by de Havilland in the Sherwood Forest scenes later gained screen stardom as Roy Rogers' Trigger. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

As the road grows increasingly dark, the eerie sight of a young woman carrying a small infant sets into motion a horrific series of roadside deaths that finds the family's numbers quickly dwindling. Though there are no other travelers on the long and dark stretch of road, the appearance of a menacing black hearse seems somehow connected to the spectral woman and her child. Could it be that a vengeful entity was the previous victim of a roadside accident, returning to torment any trespasser who happens to wander down her silent stretch of road, or could the answer to the horrific mystery lie deep within the conscience of one of the few remaining family-members? & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

On the run from the law after the robbery turns into a shoot-out, Kurt impulsively grabs a woman named Samatha (Samatha Dark) and her daughter as hostages, and head out to what they believe is an abandoned farmhouse in a sparsely populated rural village. However, the thieves and the hostages quickly discover the house is not abandoned after all; a serial killer who has been preying on the community for decades has been using the house as a base of operations, and the criminals soon find themselves at the mercy of a horror more gruesome than they could ever have imagined.

A dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues as Pope's investigation reveals that while Elizabeth, along with her servant, Irina, have no documented history, they seem bizarrely connected to the past - particularly that of Erszebet Bathory, the Transylvanian countess who murdered 650 women in order to bathe in their blood.

       "\t27 & 38 & The Matador & A chance meeting between two middle-aged men leads one into a life of crime in this offbeat comedy. Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) is an American businessman whose life has been going through a sour patch after he and his wife, Carolyn (Hope Davis), lost their young son. During a business trip to Mexico City, Danny strikes up a conversation in a hotel bar with fellow out-of-towner Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan), and while Julian's loud and brassy manner initially puts Danny off, in time the two become friends, and Julian feels comfortable enough with Danny to tell him what he does for a living. It seems Julian is a hired killer working under the auspices of underworld kingpins Lovell (Dylan Baker) and Mr. Randy (Philip Baker Hall), and Julian tries to persuade Danny to help him with his latest assignment. Danny refuses, but a few months later a distraught Julian appears unannounced on Danny's doorstep. It seems Julian has blown his two most recent assignments due to a variety of psychosomatic illnesses, and now Lovell and Mr. Randy want him dead. Julian has also done something to put Danny in his debt, and the previously non-criminal businessman is forced to help his friend stage a hit, with Julian's presence in his home upsetting the precarious balance of Danny and Carolyn's marriage. \\textasciitilde{} Mark Deming, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t28 & 39 & Smile & Two girls born at the same time on different sides of the world are brought together by an act of mercy in this drama. Katie (Mika Boorem) is a high-school student who has grown up in a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles. While Katie has never had to want for material things, she feels a certain dissatisfaction in her life, and between dealing with her combative parents (Beau Bridges and Linda Hamilton), her sexually aggressive boyfriend (Erik von Detten), and a mysterious boy who has caught her eye (Jonathan Trent), Katie is ready for a change in her life. One of Katie's teachers, Mr. Matthews (Sean Astin) persuades Katie to investigate Doctor's Gift, an international medical outreach program, as a rewarding volunteer opportunity that would look good on her college admission forms. Katie end up traveling to China with the Doctor's Gift team, where she discovers a world far different than the one she has known. Katie encounters Lin (Yi Ding), a girl who was born the same day she was but has led a very different life; facially disfigured, Lin was abandoned by her parents as an infant, and when she was taken in by Daniel (Luoyong Wang), it caused a rift that ended his marriage. The Doctor's Gift organization has offered to provide plastic surgery for Lin through their affiliated program Project Smile, but after previous surgery failed to correct her defects, Lin isn't so sure she wants to risk another disappointment. Writer and director Jeff Kramer based Smile on his daughter's experiences as a volunteer with Doctor's Gift, and the producers have pledged to donate a portion of the film's profits to the organization & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

       "\t30 & 40 & The Intruder (L'Intrus) & Claire Denis' elliptical drama L'Intrus was inspired by a short book written by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy about his heart transplant. In the film, Michel Subor (Le Petit Soldat) stars as Louis, who lives fairly self-sufficiently in a small cabin in the snowy wilds near the Swiss border. Louis has a son (Gr√©goire Colin, who also starred with Subor in the director's Beau Travail) whose wife (Florence Loiret-Caille) is a border guard, and they have two young children, but Louis has a strained relationship with his family. He lives a hard, stoic life out in the cold. Mysterious strangers cross the border at all hours of the day and night, and Louis vigilantly -- sometimes violently -- protects his homestead. It soon comes to pass that he needs a heart transplant. Louis quickly and quietly makes some arrangements, and travels to Pusan for the operation. He makes the demand that he be given a young man's heart, and not a woman's. His health still failing, Louis then travels to Tahiti, hoping for a final reunion with another son, whom he abandoned years before. The footage of the young Subor in Tahiti was taken from an uncompleted adaptation of a Robert Louis Stevenson story directed by Paul G√©gauff. L'Intrus also stars B√©atrice Dalle, Katia Golubeva, and Alex Descas in smaller roles. The film was shown by the Film Society of Lincoln Center as part of 2005's Rendez-Vous With French Cinema. \\textasciitilde{} Josh Ralske, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

In Japan&apos;s family court system, which is heavily weighted towards the mother, Yoshimi case would normally be a piece of cake. Unfortunately, Yoshimi has a history of mental imbalance as a result of her miserable, emotionally starved childhood. The transition from housewife to independent working woman has been stressful. She has moved into a fleabag of an apartment -- completely with a constantly leaking roof -- and has had little luck finding employment. Worse, Ikuko and then Yoshimi start seeing a creepy little girl dressed in yellow suddenly appearing in apartment. With a growing sense of dread, Yoshimi starts having outbursts not only in family court, but also at her daughter&apos;s kindergarten.

While it seems a straightforward enough case, there are some complicating issues involving the character and intent of the victim herself and also the culpability amongst those who witnessed the crime and did nothing to stop it. Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster in a mesmerizing Oscar-winning turn) is a hard-living sexy little fireball who loves to party with her friends. The night of the rape, she had a fight with her boy friend and so goes to the bar to blow off a little steam. In the dark back room where the pool tables sit and pinball machines flash dimly against the walls, Sarah begins casually flirting, dancing around, drinking a bit and the next thing she knows she is tossed upon a pinball machine being brutally ravaged with guys lined up to have their way with her while other patrons stand around cheering. Badly beaten and traumatized, she ends up in the DA&apos;s office facing attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) who listens and takes the case. But as Murphy learns more about Sarah, she becomes less pleased, for Sarah has a long, checkered past of drugs, booze and casual acquaintances that the defense can easily use to destroy her character. Rather than risk that, Murphy goes for a plea bargain that grants the guilty light sentences and frees them from having to admit that they committed rape. Sarah goes ballistic when she hears about the trial and harshly derides Murphy. The lawyer seems unsympathetic at first, but then she sees first hand the devastation the rape has wrought upon Sarah&apos;s life and decides to defy her bosses and continue fighting for justice using an entirely new tack. This time, instead of going after the rapists, she is going after the &apos;passive&apos; onlookers who may or may not have encouraged the crime. The Accused is loosely based upon the true story of a much-publicized 1983 case from New Bedford, Massachusetts.</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Drama, Mystery &amp; Suspense</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Jonathan Kaplan</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1988-10-14</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2002-04-16</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">110</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">91</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">22</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">79</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">20796</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">7</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">13</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">The Lost City</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Andy Garcia stars and makes his directorial debut in a passionate and historical tribute to his native Cuba.

In Peru in 1714, a rickety bridge collapsed as five people were attempting to cross, forcing them to plunge to their deaths. Brother Fray Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) is a Franciscan monk who has been given the duty of looking into the tragedy by the archbishop of Lima (Robert De Niro), and to learn what he can about the victims. It is Juniper&apos;s belief that these particular people died for some reason, and that it is his duty to determine why God chose these five people to perish, while others in the vicinity survived.

For 20 years, Frank Harrington (Ray Wise) has driven the same, mind-numbingly familiar route to the annual holiday gathering, but the discovery of an unfamiliar shortcut simply proves too enticing for the loving but strained father to resist. As the road grows increasingly dark, the eerie sight of a young woman carrying a small infant sets into motion a horrific series of roadside deaths that finds the family&apos;s numbers quickly dwindling. Though there are no other travelers on the long and dark stretch of road, the appearance of a menacing black hearse seems somehow connected to the spectral woman and her child. Could it be that a vengeful entity was the previous victim of a roadside accident, returning to torment any trespasser who happens to wander down her silent stretch of road, or could the answer to the horrific mystery lie deep within the conscience of one of the few remaining family-members?</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Comedy, Horror, Mystery &amp; Suspense</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Jean-Baptiste Andrea, Fabrice Canepa, Jean-Bapiste Andrea</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2003-09-26</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2004-11-19</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">85</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">75</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">8</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">60</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">10351</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">12</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">24</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Bandwagon</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">A group of hard-working, young North Carolinians amuse themselves in the evenings by forming a band.

After he loses his day job, his out-going friend Charlie Flagg suggests he try to become a professional musician. Tony decides to give it a go, but first they need a band. They choose stoner guitarist Wynn Knapp, who despite his perpetual drug-inspired haze is really good, and then the volatile Eric Ellwood as their bassist. Ellwood is extremely eager to get the money rolling in as he is deeply in debt to a big, mean loan shark. Unfortunately, the shark has Ellwood&apos;s bass. The four then stage a break-in and get it back. After practice, their band Circus Monkey is finally ready to perform. At least they think so and go to play at a frat party. Unfortunately they bomb because their music isn&apos;t hard enough for the rowdy, drunken kids. Undaunted, they continue on and eventually score themselves a manager with Linus Tate, a sage but quiet man. Together they set out across the South in hope of launching their careers, playing at any club that will have them.</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Comedy</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">John Schultz</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1997-09-12</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1999-02-16</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">103</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">80</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">5</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">91</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">386</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">13</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">25</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Whore</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">The world of prostitution is the focus of this unflinching drama, which blends a fictional storyline with interviews with real-life prostitutes.

       "\t6 & 12 & The Accused & Simultaneously gut-wrenching and provocative, The Accused follows the struggle of a young woman to find justice after she is publicly gang-raped in a local tavern. While it seems a straightforward enough case, there are some complicating issues involving the character and intent of the victim herself and also the culpability amongst those who witnessed the crime and did nothing to stop it. Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster in a mesmerizing Oscar-winning turn) is a hard-living sexy little fireball who loves to party with her friends. The night of the rape, she had a fight with her boy friend and so goes to the bar to blow off a little steam. In the dark back room where the pool tables sit and pinball machines flash dimly against the walls, Sarah begins casually flirting, dancing around, drinking a bit and the next thing she knows she is tossed upon a pinball machine being brutally ravaged with guys lined up to have their way with her while other patrons stand around cheering. Badly beaten and traumatized, she ends up in the DA's office facing attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) who listens and takes the case. But as Murphy learns more about Sarah, she becomes less pleased, for Sarah has a long, checkered past of drugs, booze and casual acquaintances that the defense can easily use to destroy her character. Rather than risk that, Murphy goes for a plea bargain that grants the guilty light sentences and frees them from having to admit that they committed rape. Sarah goes ballistic when she hears about the trial and harshly derides Murphy. The lawyer seems unsympathetic at first, but then she sees first hand the devastation the rape has wrought upon Sarah's life and decides to defy her bosses and continue fighting for justice using an entirely new tack. This time, instead of going after the rapists, she is going after the 'passive' onlookers who may or may not have encouraged the crime. The Accused is loosely based upon the true story of a much-publicized 1983 case from New Bedford, Massachusetts. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

After five years, Juniper delivers his findings to the archbishop as well as the viceroy of Peru (F. Murray Abraham), as Juniper tells them of the lives of the troubled Dona Maria (Kathy Bates), the nun Pepita (Adriana Dominguez), warm-hearted Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel), street kid-turned-actress La Perichola (Pilar Lopez de Ayala), and others involved in the tragedy.

Though there are no other travelers on the long and dark stretch of road, the appearance of a menacing black hearse seems somehow connected to the spectral woman and her child.

When an overwhelming horde of powerful invaders forces the hunters into slavery and abducts the princess, the once-aimless boy suddenly finds his destiny taking an unexpected turn.

Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the last surviving crew member of a corporate spaceship destroyed after an attack by a vicious, virtually unbeatable alien life form. Adrift in space for half a century, Ripley grapples with depression until she&apos;s informed by her company&apos;s representative, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) that the planet where her crew discovered the alien has since been settled by colonists. Contact with the colony has suddenly been lost, and a detachment of colonial marines is being sent to investigate. Invited along as an advisor, Ripley predicts disaster, and sure enough, the aliens have infested the colony, leaving a sole survivor, the young girl Newt (Carrie Henn). With the soldiers picked off one by one, a final all-female showdown brews between the alien queen and Ripley, who&apos;s become a surrogate mother to Newt. Several future stars made early career appearances in Aliens (1986), including Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Reiser. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Action &amp; Adventure, Horror, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">James Cameron</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1986-07-18</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">1999-06-01</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">138</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">99</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">72</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">94</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">429158</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">3</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">85</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">The Happening</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">The Happening&apos; is a lightning-paced, heart-pounding paranoid thriller about a family on the run from an inexplicable and unstoppable event that threatens not only humankind, but the most basic human instinct of them all--survival.</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Drama, Mystery &amp; Suspense, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">M.

U.S. marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) has been stationed at Antarctica&apos;s South Pole research base for two years, and now after turning in her resignation she&apos;s looking forward to finally going home. The last plane out leaves in just three days, and just after that Antarctica will not see the sun again for another 24 weeks. Then, just 72 hours before she is set to escape the coming darkness, a body is discovered in the ice -- prompting the first murder investigation ever to take place on the desolate Antarctic Circle continent. Little does Carrie realize that she&apos;s suddenly been thrust into a mystery over 60 years in the making, and that the killer is ready to strike again in order to protect a grim secret. Now, as the death toll starts to rise, loyalties shift, and a massive series of whiteouts blow bitter winds across the frozen landscape, the U.S. marshall who wanted nothing more than to escape the cold must work around the clock to catch a killer before the blinding white snow gives way to the deadly darkness of winter.</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">R</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Action &amp; Adventure, Drama, Mystery &amp; Suspense</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Dominic Sena</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2009-09-11</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">2010-01-19</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">106</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">7</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">115</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">21</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">538847</td></tr><tr><td class = \"rowNumber\" style = \"font-weight: bold; text-align: right;\">7</td><td style = \"text-align: right;\">124</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">What Happens in Vegas</td><td style = \"text-align: left;\">Two strangers (Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher) find themselves hitched after a wild night of Las Vegas shenanigans in this 20th Century Fox comedy. Jack Fuller (Kutcher) is a single Manhattanite who can never quite commit to a permanent, long-term relationship and repeatedly hears from his lovers that he &apos;isn&apos;t serious boyfriend material.&apos; Employed by his father (Treat Williams) at a local furniture business, Jack spends his workdays goofing off by watching sporting events behind dad&apos;s back. Joy McNally (Diaz) is faring slightly better; a young, polished urbanite, she juggles a demanding job as a trader on the NYSE with a marital engagement to the impressive Mason (Jason Sudeikis), but has modified her entire life and all of her interests to please her intended.Coincident with Mr. Fuller&apos;s decision to fire his son, Mason severs his engagement to Joy; as a result, both Jack and Joy hit the skids at around the same time and decide to cut their losses by heading out to Vegas. The two accidentally bump into one another when a computer mix-up at the hotel puts them in adjoining rooms; though they begin their acquaintanceship by bickering endlessly, they end up spending a long, drunken night on the town together, and when the sun rises and Joy comes to, she discovers that she unwittingly married Jack in the middle of the night. Alas, just when the two are about to call it quits by filing for divorce after the shortest marriage in history, Jack tosses a coin into a Vegas slot machine and hits a three-million-dollar jackpot -- which naturally pits the newlyweds against one another in an attempt to claim the full share of the money. A conservative local judge, R.D. Whopper (Dennis Miller), then adds the final twist by refusing to grant a divorce until Joy and Jack have given married life a fair shake. In time, the marrieds may just discover that this union isn&apos;t as far off the mark as they initially thought.

A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover&apos;s (Billy Crudup) FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? Determined to bust Dillinger and his crew, which also included sociopathic Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) and Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), Hoover christened Dillinger the country&apos;s very first Public Enemy Number One, and unleashed Purvis to take them down by whatever means necessary. But Purvis underestimated Dillinger&apos;s ingenuity as a master criminal, and after embarking on a frantic series of chases and shoot-outs, the dashing agent humbly surmised that he was in over his head. Outwitted and outgunned, Purvis knew that his only hope for busting Dillinger&apos;s gang was to baptize a crew of Western ex-lawmen as official agents, and orchestrate a series of betrayals so cunning that even America&apos;s criminal mastermind wouldn&apos;t know what hit him.

The Division is a shadowy government operation devoted to making humankind the ultimate weapon. Those who accept this transformation have the power to move objects with the mind, see the future before it happens, create new realities, and dispense of their enemies without so much as a single touch; those who are unwilling to participate are immediately terminated. Nick Gant (Chris Evans) is a &apos;mover,&apos; a second-generation telekinetic who went into hiding after the Division killed his father more than a decade earlier. He lives a life of anonymity in Hong Kong, a densely populated place where fugitive psychics such as himself are safe as long as they can keep their unique gift secret. Suddenly into Nick&apos;s life comes 13-year-old &apos;watcher&apos; Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), a clairvoyant who needs his help in tracking down escaped &apos;pusher&apos; Kira, who may hold the key to bringing down the Division once and for all. A &apos;pusher&apos; is the most powerful kind of psychic due to his or her ability to influence the actions of others by planting thoughts in their minds. Now, as Nick emerges from hiding in order to help Cassie find Kira, the Division&apos;s human bloodhounds are hot on their trail.

       "\t11 & 168 & Public Enemies & Based on author Bryan Burrough's ambitious tome Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-43, director Michael Mann's sprawling historical crime drama follows the efforts of top FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale ) in capturing notorious bank robber John Dillinger. A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Crudup) FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? Determined to bust Dillinger and his crew, which also included sociopathic Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) and Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), Hoover christened Dillinger the country's very first Public Enemy Number One, and unleashed Purvis to take them down by whatever means necessary. But Purvis underestimated Dillinger's ingenuity as a master criminal, and after embarking on a frantic series of chases and shoot-outs, the dashing agent humbly surmised that he was in over his head. Outwitted and outgunned, Purvis knew that his only hope for busting Dillinger's gang was to baptize a crew of Western ex-lawmen as official agents, and orchestrate a series of betrayals so cunning that even America's criminal mastermind wouldn't know what hit him. Marion Cotillard, Channing Tatum, and Stephen Dorff co-star. \\textasciitilde{} Jason Buchanan, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

       "\t13 & 192 & Push & Lucky Number Slevin director Paul McGuigan takes the helm for this action thriller concerning a group of telekinetic American ex-patriots who band together in an attempt to take down the clandestine government agency that's genetically transforming normal citizens into powerful psychic warriors. The Division is a shadowy government operation devoted to making humankind the ultimate weapon. Those who accept this transformation have the power to move objects with the mind, see the future before it happens, create new realities, and dispense of their enemies without so much as a single touch; those who are unwilling to participate are immediately terminated. Nick Gant (Chris Evans) is a 'mover,' a second-generation telekinetic who went into hiding after the Division killed his father more than a decade earlier. He lives a life of anonymity in Hong Kong, a densely populated place where fugitive psychics such as himself are safe as long as they can keep their unique gift secret. Suddenly into Nick's life comes 13-year-old 'watcher' Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), a clairvoyant who needs his help in tracking down escaped 'pusher' Kira, who may hold the key to bringing down the Division once and for all. A 'pusher' is the most powerful kind of psychic due to his or her ability to influence the actions of others by planting thoughts in their minds. Now, as Nick emerges from hiding in order to help Cassie find Kira, the Division's human bloodhounds are hot on their trail. In order to elude the authorities, they'll need to disappear into the seedy underbelly of the city while relying on a team of rogue psychics to help cover their tracks. But Division Agent Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) is a powerful pusher who has made it his mission to stop them at all costs, regardless of the collateral damages that may occur in the process. \\textasciitilde{} Jason Buchanan, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

Plagued by merciless dreams and a tortured ghost that haunts her waking hours, she must turn to the only spiritual advisor, Sendak, who can make it stop. With Sendak's help, Casey uncovers the source of a family curse dating back to Nazi Germany--a creature with the ability to inhabit anyone or anything that is getting stronger with each possession. With the curse unleashed, her only chance at survival is to shut a doorway from beyond our world that has been pried open by someone who was never born. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

He agrees to participate in the charade, but with a few conditions of his own. The unlikely couple heads to Alaska to meet his quirky family, and the always-in-control city girl finds herself in one comedic fish-out-of-water situation after another.

At the local orphanage, both John and Kate find themselves strangely drawn to a young girl named Esther. Almost as soon as they welcome Esther into their home, however, an alarming series of events begins to unfold, leading Kate to believe that there's something wrong with Esther-this seemingly angelic little girl is not what she appears to be.

In 48 hours, Doug is scheduled to walk down the aisle, effectively ending his reign as a rowdy bachelor. Realizing that this is their last blowout with their best friend, Doug's groomsmen organize a Sin City bachelor bash he'll never forget. The next morning, the groomsmen come to in their Caesar's Palace suite to find a tiger in the bathroom and a six-month-old baby tucked away in the closet. Unfortunately, Doug is nowhere to be found.

       "\t19 & 349 & Carrie & This classic horror movie based on Stephen King's first novel stars Sissy Spacek as Carrie White, a shy, diffident teenager who is the butt of practical jokes at her small-town high school. Her blind panic at her first menstruation, a result of ignorance and religious guilt drummed into her by her fanatical mother, Margaret (Piper Laurie), only causes her classmates' vicious cruelty to escalate, despite the attentions of her overly solicitous gym teacher (Betty Buckley). Finally, when the venomous Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) engineers a reprehensible prank at the school prom, Carrie lashes out in a horrifying display of her heretofore minor telekinetic powers. Many films had featured school bullies, but Carrie was one of the first to focus on the special brand of cruelty unique to teenage girls. Carrie's world is presented as a snake pit, where the well-to-do female students all have fangs -- even the reticent Sue Snell (Amy Irving) -- and all the males are blind pawns, sexually twisted around the fingers of Chris and her evil cronies. The talented supporting cast includes John Travolta, P.J. Soles, and William Katt. One of the genre's true classics, the film was followed by a sequel in 1999, as well as by a famously unsuccessful Broadway musical adaptation that starred Betty Buckley, the movie's gym teacher, as Margaret White. \\textasciitilde{} Robert Firsching, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

       "\t22 & 822 & Ghost & An interesting hybrid of popular film genres, Ghost showcases the talents of its entire cast. While out on the town one evening, New York couple Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) are confronted by a mugger. After submitting to his demands, Sam is murdered anyway. He then finds himself a disembodied spirit, invisible to the living world, wandering without hope until he finds a spiteful spirit aboard the subway (Vincent Schiavelli) who gives him some helpful pointers on how to co-exist. Soon Sam comes back into contact with those he knew in life, and he begins to learn piece-by-piece of his close friend and co-worker Carl's (Tony Goldwyn) embezzling plot which caused his death; the apparent mugging was, in fact, a premeditated murder. In the meantime, Carl has designs on Molly, and Sam is determined to extract revenge. He contacts a psychic (Whoopi Goldberg), and together, the two set out to serve justice and stop the maniacal Carl from getting to Molly. Blending comedy, romance, action, and horror, Ghost was a box-office smash and managed to garner five Academy Award nominations, including 'Best Picture,' 'Best Supporting Actress' (Goldberg), 'Best Original Screenplay,' 'Best Editing,' and 'Best Score'; Goldberg won her first Oscar. \\textasciitilde{} Jeremy Beday, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t23 & 835 & GoodFellas & Martin Scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling Wiseguy, the true-life account of mobster and FBI informant Henry Hill. Set to a true-to-period rock soundtrack, the story details the rise and fall of Hill, a half-Irish, half-Sicilian New York kid who grows up idolizing the 'wise guys' in his impoverished Brooklyn neighborhood. He begins hanging around the mobsters, running errands and doing odd jobs until he gains the notice of local chieftain Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), who takes him in as a surrogate son. As he reaches his teens, Hill (Ray Liotta) is inducted into the world of petty crime, where he distinguishes himself as a 'stand-up guy' by choosing jail time over ratting on his accomplices. From that moment on, he is a part of the family. Along with his psychotic partner Tommy (Joe Pesci), he rises through the ranks to become Paulie's lieutenant; however, he quickly learns that, like his mentor Jimmy (Robert DeNiro), his ethnicity prevents him from ever becoming a 'made guy,' an actual member of the crime family. Soon he finds himself the target of both the feds and the mobsters, who feel that he has become a threat to their security with his reckless dealings. Goodfellas was rewarded with six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture; Pesci would walk away with Best Supporting Actor for his work. \\textasciitilde{} Jeremy Beday, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

She tells her father that she is engaged to be married. When the shocked George asks to whom, she says his name is Bryan (George Newbern) and that he is an 'independent communications consultant.' George is even more shocked when he finds out what the wedding will cost (when George goes through the card file for invited wedding guests and is told someone is deceased, George chirps, 'He died? That's great!'). As George is ignored during the mad preparations for the wedding, he wistfully looks back to all the good times he has had with Annie and sadly looks forward to the time when he loses his little girl. \\textasciitilde{} Paul Brenner, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

The cute lite beast grows up to be the less-than-cute Beethoven, a sloppy, slobbery, oversized and extremely destructive animal. Beethoven also brings with him a lot of hidden baggage in the form of evil veterinarian Dean Jones, who'll stop at nothing to steal Beethoven for the purposes of his insidious lab experiment.

       "\t27 & 952 & Cool Runnings & Cool Runnings fictionalizes the true story of a bobsledding team from Jamaica making it to the Olympics. The tale begins when Derice Bannock (Leon), realizing that due to an accident his chances of qualifying for Jamaica's 1988 Olympic track team are dashed, scrounges around looking for another sport for the competition. Since ex-United States gold medal bobsledding winner Irv Blitzer (John Candy) now lives in Jamaica, Derice chooses bobsledding, convincing Irv to coach the team. Derice then forms his team. He gets his friend Sanka Cofie (Doug E. Doug) to join up and recruits Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis), a young man who lacks self-confidence, and Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), a disagreeable and bitter malcontent. After setbacks and near disasters, the group jells as team members and they head off to the Olympics to compete for an Olympic spot. & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t28 & 978 & The Mask & Hyperactive mayhem results when a mild-manned banker discovers an ancient mask that transforms him into a zany prankster with superhuman powers in this special-effects-intensive comedy. The wildly improvisational Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a decent-hearted but socially awkward guy who one night finds a strange mask. Carrey's trademark energy reveals itself after Stanley puts on the mask and the banker transforms into The Mask, a green-skinned, zoot-suited fireball. The rubber-faced Mask possesses the courage to do the wild, fun things that Stanley fears, including romancing Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz). In addition to Carrey's physical talents, the film makes effective use of digital visual effects that bestow the Mask with superhuman speed, insane flexibility, and popping eyes out of a Tex Avery cartoon. The larger narrative, involving the efforts of Tina's gangster boyfriend to destroy Stanley and use the mask's powers for evil, prove less interesting than the anarchic comic set pieces, including a particularly memorable dance number to 'Cuban Pete.' The film delivered enough laughs to become a surprise hit and, along with the same year's Dumb and Dumber, establish Carrey's status as a comedy superstar. \\textasciitilde{} Judd Blaise, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t29 & 1012 & Bad Boys & Former video director Michael Bay had his first big hit with this action comedy, which also returned producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson to the big-budget, high-violence movies that they successfully churned out in the '80s. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are two Miami cops who watch as 100 million dollars in heroin, from the biggest drug bust of their careers, is stolen out of the basement of police headquarters. This puts them hot on the trail of French drug lord Fouchet (Tch√©ky Karyo), who leaves a trail of bodies in his wake and only one witness, Julie Mott (T√©a Leoni), who quickly teams up with our heroes. Comic hijinks ensue when plot complications force Mike to impersonate the married Marcus, to the point of moving in with his wife and children, while Marcus takes over Mike's bachelor pad and lifestyle. Car chases, snappy one-liners, and nonstop pacing fuel this umpteenth variation on the cop 'buddy' formula. \\textasciitilde{} Don Kaye, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",
       "\t30 & 1014 & Pocahontas & History gets the Disney kiddie treatment and a politically correct interpretation in the studio's 33rd feature-length animated movie, the first to be based on actual events and people. Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) is the daughter of Algonquin chief Powhatan (Russell Means), who promises her in marriage to Kocoum, a brave whom she doesn't love. Pocahontas would rather be paddling in her canoe or wandering in the forest, communing with nature and her animal pals, Meeko, a raccoon, and the hummingbird Flit. When European settlers arrive, she becomes enamored of handsome John Smith (Mel Gibson). Their attraction is encouraged by Grandmother Willow (Linda Hunt), a talking tree. The situation between their peoples is tense, however, as the settlers, led by Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) desperately want the gold that they're sure the natives are concealing. When a dutiful sentry, Thomas (Christian Bale) follows Smith into the woods on one of his secret meetings with Pocahontas, a tragic mistake leads both groups to the brink of war. Only the love of Pocahontas and Smith can prevent bloodshed. Pocahontas (1995) was awarded two Oscars, for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score and Best Original Song for 'Colors of the Wind.' \\textasciitilde{} Karl Williams, Rovi & $\\dots$ \\\\\n",

    "## Differences from Python\n",
    "1. Library:\n",
    "In Julia, JSON parsing and serialization is typically handled by the JSON3 package, whereas in Python, this is done using the built-in json module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Structures:\n",
    "In both Julia and Python, after parsing JSON, the result is stored in a dictionary-like structure. However, the underlying data structures are different:\n",
    "Python: JSON is parsed into a dict (dictionary).\n",
    "Julia: JSON is parsed into a Dict (with the Dict type being case-sensitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Accessing Values:\n",
    "Both Julia and Python use the [] syntax to access dictionary values. In Python, the dictionary object is indexed by keys (e.g., parsed_data[\"title\"]), and the same applies in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Serialization:\n",
    "Python: json.dumps() is used to serialize a Python dictionary to a JSON string.\n",
    "Julia: JSON3.write() is used to serialize a Julia Dict into a JSON string.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. JSON Parsing and Writing Syntax:\n",
    "In Python, the built-in json library uses json.loads() for deserialization and json.dumps() for serialization. These functions operate with Python dictionaries directly.\n",
    "In Julia, the JSON3 package provides the read() function for parsing JSON strings and write() for serializing Julia objects."
